# Logo Placeholder

Please add your Curelex logo image as "logo.png" in the following locations:
1. /public/logo.png (for navbar)
2. /src/assets/logo.png (for watermark background)

The logo should be in PNG format with transparent background for best results.

Recommended dimensions:
- For navbar: 200x50 pixels
- For watermark: 500x500 pixels (will be automatically resized and made transparent)

Once you add the logo files, the website will display your logo in:
- Navigation bar (top left)
- Background watermark (center, very light opacity)
